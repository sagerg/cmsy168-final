The site is currently live **[HERE](https://phpmysql.howardcc.edu/Users/sgarcia6599/)**.

The Health Journal is a project aimed at spreading mental health awareness. It provides helpful suggestions and tips for creating a stress-free and productive environment for oneself. Originally, this was a course project from one of my classes.

## Constraints

The website must only be developed in vanilla HTML and CSS. No JavaScript or CSS frameworks stored locally or imported from CDN except for normalize.css (because that one's meta) may be used.

## Responsiveness

The most challenging part of developing a website without any help from front end frameworks is making the page responsive to smaller screens, since most people use the web on mobile devices today.

## Nav Bar Accordion

It might have been possible to do it but at the time of this project, I wasn't aware of any methods to accomplish this for `@media max-width: 480px`.

To compensate, I created two breakpoints: 720px and 480px. The first breakpoint is for tablet devices and the second is for phone screens. The navbar would instead shrink to a reasonable font-size for the `screen width` instead of collapsing into an accordion.

## Welcome Banner

The homepage's front banner is a video for `screen: max-width %`. For buffering connections or devices that are unable to play media on auto, I've provided a `thumbnail.jpeg`. The main page's banner video is provided with the most common file types:

- .mp4
- .ogv
- .webm

## Photos and Media

## Normalize.css

Although mentioned earlier that we were not to use any external CSS files (from other people) or other front end frameworks, normalize is a must for any website (it's okay because my instructor said so).

## Is that it?

Yes. Thanks for checking it out! Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
