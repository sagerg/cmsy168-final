                Keeping a healthy diet &#127822;
            </h2>
            <p>
                In today's fast-paced culture filled with academics, papers, deadlines, and work &#128221;, some may find it difficult to lead a healthy diet. Especially with the boom of fastfood giants all around the US,
                it becomes increasingly tempting to disregard (or even quit!) home cooking and just settle with the very convenient ramen noodles. What we don't see underneath all those marketing campaigns and the convenience they give is 
                the underlying impact on our health that these food have when we start to make it a habit to eat them consistently.
            </p>
            <p>
                For most, dieting signifies less intake of food overall. But this is only half of the story for healthy eating as less intake of protein and nutrients can be detrimental to your body on the short term, and can lead to negative
                psychological effects due to the sudden difference in behavior. Lessening intake on high cholesterol fatty instant noodles and cheap fast food cheeseburgers, but not sacrificing your daily eating habits is the way to go.

                Disciplining oneself by portioning what he or she eats is what's most important when eating healthy. Someone who is used to eating fast food everyday might need to replace some, not all, of those meals with a healthier alternative.
                The difficulty comes not just with building a healthy eating mindset but also the resources available around us to enable us. According to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/03/health/fast-food-consumption-cdc-study/index.html" target="_blank">CNN's article</a>,
                "an estimated 36.6% or approximately 84.8 million adults consume fast food", and this is mostly due to the pervasive fastfood industry.
