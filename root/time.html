                Effective time management &#8986;
            </h2>
            <p>
                We seldom start our day by planning ahead. In the morning, we go through the motions of breakfast and taking a shower while thinking about what's in front of us. Some of you might be looking forward to spending your
                day with family, friends, or a significant other. Others may be dreading their finals later in the afternoon, and thereafter looking for others in the same boat &#9972;. In either case, managing your time wisely will 
                enable you to be ready for what's ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
                One method I use to manage my time wisely is by building a mental pie chart of the things I have to do today, tomorrow, next week, and so on and so forth. This enables me to visualize my objectives from most urgent to
                least urgent. With a student, for example, he or she can make a checklist of all the deadlines he or she has per subject, and be able to stack down from that list. In any case, since the most urgent task would've been
                finished first, there is breathing room for the others.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a multitude of ways that one can really fix a good schedule or to-do list &#128198; so that it works for you, and not against you. Here's a few that I've cooked up:
                    <br><br>
                        1. Be mindful of the time of day.<br>
                        2. Remember your resources (not just Google but also your friends).<br>
                        3. Take a 15 minute break &#9201; so that you don't get overwhelmed.<br>
                        4. Don't get too caught up with all the other deadlines. Stay focused on one task.<br>
                        5. Get some sleep the night before you start your day so that you are energized and ready.
                    <br><br>
                Hopefully some, if not most, will be useful to you on your crusade towards a more effective time management.
