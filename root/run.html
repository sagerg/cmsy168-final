                Exercising and discipline &#128170;
            </h2>
            <p>
                Exercise is one of many factors that constitute a healthy well being. Not only does it increase your strength, stamina, and resistance, but it also helps you build overall discipline. Exercise can take many forms. The most common are 
                going to the gym and doing reps, sets, or cardio training on the treadmills. But exercise is not exclusively done on a track field or in a gym. Whether you're going to work, school, or to grab a cup of coffee,
                taking a walk or going up a flight of stairs can be an exercise. The most important thing is to move throughout the day, and not delegating yourself to one position or place all day.

                One way that you can reach maximum performance with your workouts and use the least amount of time is by doing HIIT workouts in the morning. <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a25335864/high-intensity-interval-training/" target="_blank">This article</a>
                details it very well but in summary: HIIT is a high intensity interval training or routine that seeks to exert as much pressure and performance on your body in short bursts. For example, a set of running dashes and sprints that is done repeatedly and under a 
                very short amount of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                While HIIT is a good way to go about your routine, there are other ways. Each and everyone has different strengths and preferences with going about health. So be comfortable with what you can do and stick to that routine.
