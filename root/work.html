                The 40-hour work week &#9881;
            </h2>
            <p>
                We're all aware that work is important. Not only does it get you up in the morning with a purpose but it also gives us some sweet rewards &#128176;. With all these things in mind, unfortunately, most of the culture 
                surrounding work today revolves around going above and beyond. This <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-alexis-ohanian-hustle-porn-toxic-dangerous-thing-in-tech-2018-11" target="_blank">hustle mentality</a> is good for growth (yes.) 
                but if taken too far, can be detrimental to a person's health, both physically and mentally (yikes). We're all eager to work our hardest and reach those career goals, but taking some time off to recover and rest should also be a priority of ours too.
            </p>
            <p>
                If racked up for deadlines and time constraints, here are 5 ways you can show yourself some love without relieving some precious work hours:
                <br><br>
                    1. If you're allowed to, listen to some music while grinding.<br>
                    2. Team up with classmates or workmates when the task gets too difficult.<br>
                    3. Take some intermittent breaks when doing multiple tasks.<br>
                    4. Drink something hot and soothing (like coffee or tea!).<br>
                    5. Being on a call or just talking with somebody while working can boost your mood up to 10x.
            </p>
            <p>
                Main takeaway: working doesn't have to be tedious if you have people with you and your mind is stimulated by something in the background. This can be cafe chatter, rain noise, tea, or soothing jazz on your earphones.
