                Consistent sleep schedule &#128164;
            </h2>
            <p>
                Ever heard of the term "circadian rhythm"? <a href="https://www.jcircadianrhythms.com/" target="_blank">Research</a> suggests that living things have internal body clocks that tell us when to go to sleep, and when to start grinding for 
                the day. Think of it like the bedtime app on your iPhone. That rhythm is what keeps our body on schedule for basic body processes like metabolism and regeneration of cells. When that rhythm is messed with, we are 
                faced with <a href="http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/need-sleep/whats-in-it-for-you/health" target="_blank"> higher risks of obesity and diabetes</a>. Turns out sleeping in isn't such a bad idea.

                It's no easy task nowadays to be in bed early. With so much miscellaneous distractions all around us like mobiles, laptops, social media, and phones, it seems so much more natural now to be in bed WHILE using your smartphone &#128241; to do other
                things (like surf the web or watch a video). And we often excuse ourselves because we consider these habits to be our method of resting or relaxing. While there is nothing inherently wrong with this, when taken too far and too habitually,
                these really do become bad habits.

                Often, we see people engrossed more with their mobile screens instead of their surroundings, which can cause some harm if unaware of anything disadvantageous in the environement they are in. In terms
                of sleep, this can take away some hours of our sleep since our bodies have the tendency to stay awake &#128065; when faced with a brightly lit screen. As a side effect to this modern way of living, it has become naturalized
                within to have a handheld device before going to bed. Most teens and youth with a smartphone often do this. This conversation has been a very major topic for pediatricians and parents across the country.
