            <p>
                We seldom start our day by planning ahead. In the morning, we go through the motions of breakfast and taking a shower while thinking about what's in front of us. Some of you might be looking forward to spending your
                day with family, friends, or a significant other. Others may be dreading their finals later in the afternoon, and thereafter looking for others in the same boat. In either case, managing your time wisely will 
                enable you to be ready for what's ahead.

            <p>
                Ever heard of the term "circadian rhythm"? <a href="https://www.jcircadianrhythms.com/" target="_blank">Research</a> suggests that living things have internal body clocks that tell us when to go to sleep, and when to start grinding for 
                the day. Think of it like the bedtime app on your iPhone. That rhythm is what keeps our body on schedule for basic body processes like metabolism and regeneration of cells. When that rhythm is messed with, we are 
                faced with <a href="http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/need-sleep/whats-in-it-for-you/health" target="_blank"> higher risks of obesity and diabetes</a>. Turns out sleeping in isn't such a bad idea.

            <h2 id = "diet-tips">Keeping a healthy diet &#127822;</h2>
            <p>
                In today's fast-paced culture filled with academics, papers, deadlines, and work, some may find it difficult to lead a healthy diet. Especially with the boom of fastfood giants all around the US,
                it becomes increasingly tempting to disregard (or even quit!) home cooking and just settle with the very convenient ramen noodles. What we don't see underneath all those marketing campaigns and the convenience they give is 
                the underlying impact on our health that these food have when we start to make it a habit to eat them consistently.

            <p>
                We're all aware that work is important. Not only does it get you up in the morning with a purpose but it also gives us some sweet rewards. With all these things in mind, unfortunately, most of the culture 
                surrounding work today revolves around going above and beyond. This <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-alexis-ohanian-hustle-porn-toxic-dangerous-thing-in-tech-2018-11" target="_blank">hustle mentality</a> is good for growth (yes.) 
                but if taken too far, can be detrimental to a person's health, both physically and mentally (yikes). We're all eager to work our hardest and reach those career goals, but taking some time off to recover and rest should also be a priority of ours too.

            <h2 id = "work-out">Exercising and discipline &#128170;</h2>
            <p>
                Exercise is one of many factors that constitute a healthy well being. Not only does it increase your strength, stamina, and resistance, but it also helps you build overall discipline. Exercise can take many forms. The most common are 
                going to the gym and doing reps, sets, or cardio training on the treadmills. But exercise is not exclusively done on a track field or in a gym. Whether you're going to work, school, or to grab a cup of coffee,
                taking a walk or going up a flight of stairs can be an exercise. The most important thing is to move throughout the day, and not delegating yourself to one position or place all day.
