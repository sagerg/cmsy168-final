                Having some key guidelines on how you go throughout your day are just as important as the
                tasks you have. Take some time to think about the small things that you do and how you can 
                improve yourself through them incrementally. Whether that's
                sleeping earlier than your usual bedtime, eating less junk food, or getting some exercise
                on the weekend, any will do. On here, you might find some helpful notes on these small—but not
                so easy—everyday tasks. Take a look around.

                Exercising doesn't have to be boring! A refreshing way to stay on top of your
                runs while still hanging out with friends and family is to join a fun run. There's
                plenty of them happening, and most are towards a good cause!
